# ‚è∞ Analog Clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to the **Analog Clock** project! This project showcases a beautifully designed, fully functional analog clock, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is a simple yet effective demonstration of how web technologies can be combined to create interactive components like clocks.

## üöÄ Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://decodersami.github.io/Analog-Clock/).

## ‚ú® Features

- A real-time **analog clock** with an intuitive design.
- **Responsive design**: The clock adjusts its size based on the viewport.
- **Smooth animations** for the clock's hands, updated dynamically using JavaScript.
- Accurate representation of **hours**, **minutes**, and **seconds**.
- Clean and minimal UI created using modern **CSS styling**.
- You can see the current day date.
- Will be add weather forecast features as well.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The structural framework of the clock.
- **CSS**: For styling and positioning elements, and for creating smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Used to calculate the time and move the clock's hands dynamically in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **HTML**: Defines the clock face, with div elements for the hour, minute, and second hands.
2. **CSS**: Styles the clock face and the hands, and ensures the layout is responsive. It also defines keyframe animations for the smooth movement of the hands.
3. **JavaScript**: Retrieves the current time from the user's device and calculates the degree of rotation required for each hand (hours, minutes, seconds). This information is used to rotate the hands accordingly.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started
